# All About Docker

***Definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29)***

**Docker** is a Computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization. It was first released in 2013 and is developed by [Docker, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker,_Inc. "Docker, Inc.")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)#cite_note-os4u-8)
Docker is used to run software packages called [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization) "Container (virtualization)"). Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own application, tools, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single [operating-system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) "Kernel (operating system)") and are thus more lightweight than [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual machine"). Containers are created from _images_ that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories.
